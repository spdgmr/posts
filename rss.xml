    <p>Wanted to state my opinion on a problem that's getting bigger and bigger. A problem that's getting bigger with each day is that we're making technology easier but it's also getting more and more "evil" with big tech companies (FAANG for example) collecting and selling our data for monetary gain. </p>
    <p>So then we turn to alternatives (Usually free software and Linux) which is a good thing, more people caring about their online privacy. </p>
    <p>The problem is how we approach these new users. We want it to be easy for them but in the process of making it easy for new users we're also making it a nightmare for experienced users and slowly making Linux just as bloated as those proprietary operating systems. </p>
    <p>What do I mean with "bloat" since that term is kind of a meme by now? </p>
    <p>Nowdays most of the software we use is bloated. The websites you visit likely have a lot of JavaScript in them (Facebook, Google, Discord, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) which forces us to have bloated web browsers for viewing those pages slowing down older computers. Additionally this also requires a GUI program which some users might not want. </p>
    <p>But even if you avoid the web there's still bloat in a lot of software. A lot of software on Linux now is packaged using Universal packaging like Snap packages (Canonical), Flatpaks (Red Hat), and AppImages (some random idiot).</p>
    <p>Now since soydevs decide to package using these and since these are universal, every single package has </p>
    <p>-to have support for every distro which obviously is very bloated and probably moreso than .dmgs containing a binary on macOS or a .exe since there are more Linux distros than macOS versions/Windows versions. </p> 
    <p>Thing is, when you're trying to keep your system minimal for multiple reasons (Could be old hardware or </p> 
    <p>you simply like minimal software) these packages are just not an option. You might say, "Just compile from source" (as if I'm not already using Portage) </p> 
    <p>And yes, I can definitely see your point but the problem comes when software is *absolutely proprietary*, because you can't exactly compile software without the source code in your hands. </p> 
    <p>Now proprietary software is NOT minimal, obviously however whenever you need to install a piece of proprietary software you may in some cases be forced to use one of these bloated packages since the proprietary software developer is too lazy to actually use the distro specific package managers or AT LEAST provide a tarball for the user. </p> 
    <p>So what are these universal package formats good for? Well, they're good for Windows/macOS normies who are used to things *just-working* without any tinkering. But problem comes when everyone starts adopting-</p> 
    <p>this new fancy packaging format. Because once these become standard (I definitely predict they will), you will be forced to use them (unless the software is free and open source). </p>
    <p>TLDR; By using bloated universal packages and making it easy for the normies, you're making it harder for minimal Linux users/experienced users who REALLY hate universal packaging. </p> 
    <p>So please, if you're going to distribute software, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE provide packaging for the distro's native package manager (Apt for Debian/Ubuntu, Pacman for Arch, Rpm for Red Hat, Portage for Gentoo, XBPS for Void, etc.). </p> 
    <p>Thank you and have a good day</p>

    <p>This is a notice for spDE users. It now comes with newsboat and this RSS feed built in. There may or may not be a keybind but you can access it from the terminal by running 'newsboat'.</p> 
    <p>Thank you for using spDE.</p>

    <title>Dear soydevs: Stop making desktop applications bloated.</title>
    <link>https://spdgmr.github.io/post03</link>

    <p>Today I wanted to talk about something else. I guess it's kinda related to my previous post titled "Stop making Linux user friendly.. sort of".</p>
    <p>Modern software has this problem, a very huge problem. "Bloat". Now bloat can be caused by many different aspects. Programming language, po-</p>
    <p>orly written code, unnecessary features, etc. but the main one I wanna talk about is called "Electron".</p>
    <p>Now if you're not familiar with Electron, it's basically a minimal version of Chromium designed to create individual desktop applications from</p>
    <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This makes it easy to create desktop applications as long as you know a lot about web development.</p>
    <p>In fact many desktop applications you might be using (Almost all of them are proprietary) use Electron.</p>
    <p>Examples of these are: GitHub Desktop, balenaEtcher, Discord, Spotify, and yes, even a text editor, Visual Studio Code or as I like to call it, "SoyDev Code".</p>
    <p>If you've viewed my page, https://spdgmr.github.io/hate, you'll know that both Electron and the JavaScript programming language is there on my list.</p>
    <p>Either way, JavaScript is a VERY bloated language and is often obfuscated making it harder to see spyware, even if it's TECHNICALLY open source.</p>
    <p>Now JavaScript is becoming more popular in web development and this fact is pissing people who want a minimal system off.</p>
    <p>So to make it worse, since Electron allows you to turn HTML+CSS+JS into a desktop application, this means JS will be used for software as well.</p>
    <p>You might say, "I have a fast computer so I don't care if the software is bloated or not" and while that's a fair point, what if someone doesn't have a fast computer or just simply l-</p>
    <p> ikes minimal software. Then they're essentially forced to use this bloated slow application just because a developer was too lazy to actually learn another language.</p>
    <p>TLDR; The web is extremely bloated and since Electron turns "the web" into a desktop application, software on the desktop is getting bloated too.</p>
    <p>So what do I want? I want developers to STOP using this Electron trash.</p>
    <p>Thank you and have a good day!</p>

    <title>What you can expect from Project 081 0.6</title>
    <link>https://spdgmr.github.io/post04</link>
    <guid>https://spdgmr.github.io/post04</guid>

    <p>This is an update for Project 081 users (if there still are any). As this project has slowly died I would like to finally finish it as I have been</p>
    <p>working on other stuff like gentoo-install, spDE, my RSS feed, sfetch and various other projects.</p>
    <p>After I spent more time with Linux and stuff my older Mac OS X project kinda.. died. So therefore my goal is to finish Project 081 soon so that</p>
    <p>it's as good as it can possibly be. All the assets are (hopefully) complete however it has yet to be "compiled" together into an image for the user.</p>
    <p>So while you wait, here's a list of a bunch of changes i've made to Project 081 as well as a few I'm going to do.</p>
    <p>- Project 081 0.6/1.0 now comes with sfetch</p>
    <p>- Project 081 0.6/1.0 might come with an RSS reader as well as my feed.</p>
    <p>- Project 081 0.6/1.0 will FINALLY fix AirPort for iMac8,1 users.</p>
    <p>- Project 081 0.6/1.0 will hopefully boot on all systems.</p>
    <p>- Project 081 0.6/1.0 will hopefully be a single image with a single package that determines what to install based on sysctl hw.model</p>
    <p>- Project 081 0.6/1.0 will be an even smaller image</p>
    <p>- Project 081 0.6/1.0 will have a preinstalled image available.</p>
    <p>- Project 081 0.6/1.0 will FINALLY come with drivers for newer Apple keyboards</p>
    <p>That's basically what you can expect, if you have any more suggestions please create an Issue on GitHub.</p>
    <p>That's all, Have a good day!</p>

	<title>Happy 20th Birthday Arch Linux!</title>

	<p>So today, 2022-03-11 depending on your time zone marks 20 years since Arch Linux was released to the public.</p>
	<p>I would like to show some respect by creating this very post. Arch Linux is still one of the best Linux distributions today and I use it on a few machines.</p>
	<p>Even though I personally use Gentoo, Arch Linux was what got me into minimal Linux distributions and bloat-free software so I believe we should give it the respect it deserves.</p>
	<p>So thank you Arch Linux for being "different" and being minimal. Although I don't agree with some of your decisions such as switching from OpenRC to Systemd, you're one of the most popular distros and managed to get many people away from the bloated</p>
	<p>Linux distributions to something minimal and DIY. You even basically created Linux elitism by making an OS</p>
	<p>that's difficult to install. Happy 20th Birthday Arch Linux and thank you for reading this.</p>
