    <![CDATA[<p>So I've noticed that I haven't made it clear enough so.. IT'S MOVING TIME :D</p>
    <p>I've been updating this older rss.xml for a while now but you people who have been using this one exclusively has missed out on at least two posts.</p>
    <p>The new RSS feed (which has ALL older posts) can be found <a href="https://speedie.gq/rss.xml">here.</a>.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your support and have a good day</p>]]>
